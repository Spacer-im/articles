# Python for Astronomers or Astronomy for Pythonistas

Inspired by ["Scientists at work: most days in the life of an astronomer arenâ€™t spent at telescopes"](http://theconversation.com/scientists-at-work-most-days-in-the-life-of-an-astronomer-arent-spent-at-telescopes-40046)

## The Astropy Project

*website:* [http://www.astropy.org/](http://www.astropy.org/)

> The Astropy Project is a community effort to develop a single core package for Astronomy in Python and foster interoperability between Python astronomy packages.


## Trillian

*website:* http://trillianverse.org/

> Trillian is a project whose aim is to bridge the gap between astrophysical models and the vast amount of publicly available astronomical data.

## Astro Python

*website:* http://www.astropython.org/

> The purpose of this web site is to act as a community knowledge base for performing astronomy research with Python. It provides a variety of tutorials, code snippets, resources, lists of useful packages, general discussion, advice and also features news items, event information and announcements.

## AstroML

*website:* http://www.astroml.org/

> AstroML is a Python module for machine learning and data mining built on numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and astropy, and distributed under the 3-clause BSD license. It contains a growing library of statistical and machine learning routines for analyzing astronomical data in Python, loaders for several open astronomical datasets, and a large suite of examples of analyzing and visualizing astronomical datasets.

## ASteCA

*website:* http://asteca.github.io/

> The Automated Stellar Cluster Analysis (ASteCA) package is designed to fully automatize the usual tests applied on star clusters in order to determine their characteristics: center, radius, stars' membership probabilities and associated intrinsic/extrinsic parameters: metallicity, age, reddening, distance, total mass, binarity fraction, etc.


## Practical Python for Astronomers

*website*: https://python4astronomers.github.io/

> Practical Python for Astronomers is a series of hands-on workshops to explore the Python language and the powerful analysis tools it provides. The emphasis is on using Python to solve real-world problems that astronomers are likely to encounter in research.
